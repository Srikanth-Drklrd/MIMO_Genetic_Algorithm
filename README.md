Introduction:

Beamforming is a crucial technique in multi-antenna systems, particularly in 5G networks and beyond. However, optimizing beamforming for mobile entities such as drones, fleets, and handheld devices is challenging due to rapid changes in communication channels. This project explores genetic algorithms as a means to optimize the beamforming process in real-time.

Problem Statement

In dynamic environments, such as vehicles or drones in motion, conventional static beamforming algorithms struggle to adapt quickly enough to maintain optimal communication. This results in reduced signal strength, dropped connections, and inefficient use of network resources. The problem intensifies with multi-antenna systems, where dynamic optimization is essential for keeping up with changing spatial configurations.

Proposed Solution

We propose using a genetic algorithm to optimize beamforming weights in real-time as a solution to dynamic signal degradation. The genetic algorithm searches for the optimal beamforming configuration by mimicking the process of natural selection, evolving a population of possible solutions through crossover and mutation. Our approach adjusts antenna weights dynamically to improve signal quality, even when devices or drones are in motion.

Key Features:

Real-time Dynamic Beamforming: The system continuously monitors signal quality and adapts antenna weights.
Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Antenna configurations evolve over time to maximize signal strength.
Supports Multiple Use Cases: Ideal for scenarios involving mobile devices, drones, and fleet systems in dynamic conditions.
Technologies Used

SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) addressed: SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Use Cases
1. Drones:
Dynamic beamforming ensures uninterrupted communication as drones move through different spatial zones.

2. Fleet Management:
Mobile fleets can benefit from optimized beamforming for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.

3. Mobile Devices:
Enhances signal reception and stability for mobile devices in crowded urban environments.
